                When we talk about "Personal Information" in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device
                Information and Order Information.

                and/or order confirmations). Additionally, we use this Order Information to:
                Communicate with you;
                Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud; and
                When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or advertising
                relating to our products or services.
                We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in
                particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by
                generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the
                success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).
